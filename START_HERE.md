# 🎉 Your App is Ready!

## ✅ What's Done:
- Database tables created in Neon
- API routes connected to Neon
- Frontend updated to use API calls
- Data now persists across page refreshes!

## 🚀 How to Run:

### 1. Start the Dev Server

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL='postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_cRwWJ7FLxp3S@ep-wispy-truth-a7w1svg1-pooler.ap-southeast-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require'; npm run dev
```

### 2. Open Your Browser

Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### 3. Add Some Test Data

**Option A: Use the seed script**
```powershell
npx tsx scripts/seed-simple.ts
```

This creates:
- 2 teachers (johnsmith/1234567890, janedoe/0987654321)
- 4 students
- Sample attendance records

**Option B: Add manually through the UI**
1. Login as admin (username: `c`, password: `c`)
2. Go to "Manage People" tab
3. Add teachers and students

## 🧪 Test It:

1. **Add a teacher** in admin panel
2. **Refresh the page** (F5)
3. **Teacher is still there!** ✅ (saved in database)

4. **Add a student** and assign to teacher
5. **Refresh the page**
6. **Student is still there!** ✅

7. **Login as teacher**
8. **Mark attendance**
9. **Refresh the page**
10. **Attendance is saved!** ✅

## 📊 View Your Database:

```powershell
npx prisma studio
```

Opens a GUI at http://localhost:5555 to see all your data in Neon!

## 🔄 How It Works Now:

### Before:
```
Add teacher → React useState → Refresh → Data gone ❌
```

### Now:
```
Add teacher → API call → Neon database → Refresh → Data loads from DB ✅
```

## 🎯 What Happens:

1. **Page loads** → Fetches all data from Neon
2. **You add a teacher** → POST to `/api/teachers` → Saves to Neon
3. **You refresh** → Fetches from Neon again → All data is there!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### "Failed to load data"
- Make sure dev server is running
- Check the DATABASE_URL is set correctly

### "Teacher login failed"
- Make sure you've added teachers first through admin panel
- Or run the seed script to create test teachers

### Port 3000 already in use
```powershell
# Kill the process on port 3000
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess -Force
```

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your app now has:
- ✅ Real database (Neon PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Persistent data
- ✅ API backend
- ✅ Working frontend

Everything you add will be saved permanently!
